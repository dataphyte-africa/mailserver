# Mailserver - Newsletter Management System

## Tech Stack
- **CMS:** Statamic (Antlers templating)
- **Backend:** Laravel
- **Frontend:** Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS, Blade
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Cache/Queue:** Redis
- **Hosting:** Cloudways VPS
- **Email Delivery:** Elastic Email (API v4)

---

## Collection / Product Model

The DB-backed publishing model is:

- `collection` = newsletter family / org-level publishing bucket
- `blueprint` = product under that collection
- `entry` = one issue within that product

Current active mapping:

| Collection | Family label | Product blueprints |
|---|---|---|
| `foundation_newsletters` | Foundation Newsletters | `weekly`, `activities`, `project_update` |
| `insight_newsletters` | Insight Newsletters | `pocket_science`, `senorrita`, `marina_maitama`, `data_dive` |
| `policy_point_newsletters` | Policy Point Newsletters | `policy_point` |

Operational note:
- `collections.foundation_newsletters.foundation_newsletters` still exists in the DB as an unused legacy/default blueprint handle and is not currently backing live entries.

---

## Subscriber Groupings

### 1. Insight Subscribers
Can send to all Insight Subscribers or individual sub-groups:
- **Pocket Science** - editorial vertical
- **Marina & Maitama** - editorial vertical
- **SenorRita** - editorial vertical (SenorRita brand)
- **Data Dive** - editorial vertical

### 2. Foundation
- **Weekly** - weekly foundation digest
- **Activities** - foundation activities and events
- **Project Update** - foundation project and program update

### 3. Policy Point
- **Regular** - Policy Point recipient bucket

### Subscriber Source Mapping
- Subscribers from **Dataphyte Insight website** → Insight Subscribers group
- Subscribers from **Foundation website** → Foundation group
- Sub-group assignment based on options selected at source
- Contacts are **imported by admins** (CSV upload or manual entry), not self-subscribed via form
- Groups and sub-groups are not exhaustive — new ones can be added in the CP without code changes

### Newsletter Sending Logic
- Send to a specific sub-group (e.g., only "Pocket Science")
- Send to all sub-groups within a group (e.g., all Insight Subscribers)
- Send to all subscribers across all groups

## Email Links in Every Newsletter

| Link | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Unsubscribe | Signed URL per subscriber | System-generated |
| Manage preferences | Signed URL per subscriber | System-generated |
| View in browser | Stored campaign HTML | System route |
| Social / website links | Static org links | Statamic globals (managed in CP) |
| Physical address | Required by CAN-SPAM | Statamic globals (managed in CP) |

### Third-Party Services Needed

## Database Schema (MySQL - beyond Statamic flat files)

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `subscriber_groups` | Top-level groupings (Insight Subscribers, Foundation) |
| `subscriber_sub_groups` | Sub-groups within groups (Pocket Science, Weekly, etc.) |
| `subscribers` | Email, name, status, confirmation, consent data |
| `subscriber_sub_group` | Pivot: subscribers <-> sub-groups (many-to-many) |
| `campaigns` | Newsletter campaigns (draft/scheduled/sending/sent) |
| `campaign_audiences` | Which groups/sub-groups a campaign targets |
| `campaign_sends` | Individual send records with tracking status |
| `campaign_link_clicks` | Detailed click tracking per link |
| `email_templates` | Reusable newsletter templates |

---

## Redis Queue Architecture

| Queue | Purpose | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `campaigns` | Campaign dispatch (fans out individual emails) | High |
| `emails` | Individual email send jobs | Default |
| `webhooks` | Inbound Elastic Email webhook processing | High |
| `tracking` | Deferred tracking updates (batch DB writes) | Low |

---

## Scheduled Tasks

| Schedule | Task | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Every 5 min | `campaigns:dispatch-scheduled` | Send campaigns at scheduled time |
| Hourly | `stats:sync-elastic-email` | Reconcile stats with Elastic Email API |
| Daily | `subscribers:cleanup-unconfirmed` | Remove unconfirmed subscribers after 7 days |
| Daily | `queue:prune-failed --hours=168` | Clean old failed jobs |
| Weekly | `campaigns:generate-reports` | Weekly campaign performance digest |

## Compliance Requirements

### CAN-SPAM
- Physical mailing address in every email
- Clear unsubscribe link in every email
- One-click unsubscribe via `List-Unsubscribe` header (RFC 8058)
- Accurate From/Subject lines

### GDPR
- Double opt-in (email confirmation)
- Consent records (IP, timestamp, user agent)
- Right to erasure (delete subscriber + all data)
- Data export (JSON/CSV)
- Privacy policy link on subscription forms
- Preference center for group management

### Security
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Rate-limited subscription endpoints
- Signed URLs for unsubscribe links
- Webhook origin verification
- Statamic CP access gated by roles/permissions
- Auto-suppress bounced/complained subscribers

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Group/sub-group management
- [ ] Public subscription form (Alpine.js)
- [ ] Double opt-in flow
- [ ] Unsubscribe flow with signed URLs
- [ ] Preference center page

### Phase 3: Campaign Engine (Week 3-5)
- [x] Scaffold collections, blueprints, taxonomy, terms to DB (`newsletter:scaffold`)
- [x] Email template system — 5 Blade templates (insight: feature-lead, digest, single-story; foundation: weekly, activities)
- [x] `NewsletterMailable` — envelope, content, headers (List-Unsubscribe), UTM injection
- [x] `AudienceResolver` service — dedup subscriber IDs from group/sub-group targets
- [x] `DispatchCampaignJob` — bulk CampaignSend creation, fan-out to email queue
- [x] `SendNewsletterEmailJob` — rate-limited (300/min), 3 retries, backoff
- [x] `campaigns:dispatch-scheduled` artisan command, scheduled every 5 min

- [ ] Configure Supervisor on Cloudways
- [ ] Set up cron job on Cloudways

### Phase 4: Tracking & Analytics (Week 5-6)

- [x] `ProcessWebhookJob` — maps 15+ Elastic Email event variants, updates campaign_sends, records link clicks, auto-suppresses bounces/complaints/unsubscribes
- [x] `SyncCampaignStats` command (`campaigns:sync-stats --hours=2`) — hourly fallback reconciliation via API
- [x] `AnalyticsController` — overview dashboard, per-campaign detail, webhook log viewer
- [x] Analytics CP views — KPI cards, bar charts, open-time distribution, link click table, failed sends, webhook health panel
- [x] Analytics nav item + 3 CP routes + public webhook route
